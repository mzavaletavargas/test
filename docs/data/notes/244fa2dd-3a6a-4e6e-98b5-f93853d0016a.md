Installing the AWS Integration could increase the number of servers and Lambda functions that Datadog monitors. For more information on how this may affect your billing, visit the Billing FAQ page.

Datadog uses CloudWatch APIs to monitor your AWS resources every 10 minutes. See the AWS Integration FAQ for more information.
Enabling the AWS X-Ray integration increases the amount of Indexed Spans which can impact your bill.
