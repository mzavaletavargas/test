## Avoid 80 port

Avoid running our Node.js app on port 80
In most cases is not a good idea to start our app on port 80.

### Why?

On linux environments root access is needed to use the ports <= 1024

### What is the main problem?

We are exposed, attackers can find the way to run commands for them using root privileges.

Posible Solutions:

A reverse proxy like nginx
