## Motivation

We are planning to add new features to our application, will be good to have a "picture" for our api that can show how is the performance of our application today. A good advantage is to identify if future changes are affecting the current state of our application.

## Some APM's (Application Performance Management)

- new relic
- nsolid
- datadog
- sentry
- raygun
- scout

## Some Standard Profilers

- v8-profiler

## Other visualization profiling tools

Clinic-js

- Flame
- bubleprof
- doctor mem cpu

## New Relic

### Considerations

Only use versions supported LTS node

Node.js version Comments
6 - 10
Fully supported

11, 12
Not yet fully supported. See related GitHub documentation.

There are some frameworks available like express and restify that are supported.

### Installation

Is really straigh fordward
<https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent>

### Using Autocannon

npm i autocannon -g

sample:

```bash
autocannon -c 5 -d 99999 -t 20 -a 100 -b -i profiling/createbody.json -m POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "accesstoken: token" http://localhost:3000/test
```

### Test 1

```bash

Stat 2.5% 50% 97.5% 99% Avg Stdev Max
Latency 14389 ms 17731 ms 33232 ms 33232 ms 19551.2 ms 4577.49 ms 33232.82 ms

Stat 1% 2.5% 50% 97.5% Avg Stdev Min
Req/Sec 0 0 0 1 0.19 0.4 1
Bytes/Sec 0 B 0 B 0 B 319 B 60.6 B 125 B 319 B

Req/Bytes counts sampled once per second.

30 requests in 158.62s, 9.57 kB read
70 errors (0 timeouts)
```

and also reduce the parallel work from 5 concurrent connections to 4.

We had an anormaly using it, and the application shut down informing that we reach a heap size limit.

![first error](./assets/images/2019-07-01-19-41-49.png)

We check on new relic

![ram](./assets/images/2019-07-01-19-42-46.png)

![cpu](./assets/images/2019-07-01-19-43-07.png)

We found the problem that was draining memory ram.

The test seems to be working as expected.

![cpu](./assets/images/2019-07-01-19-54-25.png)

## Conclusions

Having an APM to give us feedback about our aplication, is really helpfull and almost necesary because it can show us wether the cpu, ram or the response time are increasing. Also what feature caused that and make desicions based on this information.

## Profiling with ClinicJS

### Flame

- The function on the bottom is the function on-CPU. The higher up the y-axis, the further nested the function.
- The width of each function on the graph represents the amount of time it took that function to execute as a percentage of the total time of its parent function.
- Finding functions that are both high on the y-axis (deeply nested) and wide on the x-axis (time-intensive) is a great way to narrow down performance and optimization issues

```bash
Stat    2.5%    50%     97.5%    99%      Avg        Stdev     Max
Latency 4323 ms 5711 ms 10033 ms 10033 ms 5978.53 ms 1402.1 ms 10033.16 ms

Stat      1%  2.5% 50%   97.5% Avg   Stdev Min
Req/Sec   0   0    1     1     0.57  0.53  1
Bytes/Sec 0 B 0 B  319 B 319 B 179 B 168 B 319 B

Req/Bytes counts sampled once per second.

36 requests in 214.65s, 11.5 kB read
4 errors (4 timeouts)
```

#### Conclusion

We can visualize CPU consumption and know is there is blocking code to take action about it.

### Doctor

```bash
autocannon -c 4 -d 99999 -t 20 -a 40 -b -i profiling/createbody.json -m POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "accesstoken: token" http://localhost:3000/test
