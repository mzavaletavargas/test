## What is it?

NGINX is a web server which can also be used as a reverse proxy, software load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.

Nginx uses an asynchronous event-driven approach, rather than threads, to handle requests.[22] Nginx's modular event-driven architecture can provide more predictable performance under high loads.

## Why do we need this web server?

- Higher performance serving static files
- SSL/TLS termination
- Be a first layer for security.

### Avoid running our Node.js app on port 80

On linux environments root access is needed to use the ports <= 1024

We are exposed, attackers can find the way to run commands for them using root privileges.

Use a web server that has reverse proxy instead, in other words use NGINX.

## Reverse proxy

Reverse Proxy get all the incoming request, do a bunch of operations for us, and response back to the client.

## Load Balancer

Distributes workload among our servers preventing overloading, continue serving to clients even if one of the nodes shut down, increase server capacity.

[How to load Balancing NodeJs apps using Nginx?](http://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html)

```
Reverse proxy servers and load balancers are components in a client-server computing architecture. Both act as intermediaries in the communication between the clients and servers, performing functions that improve efficiency. They can be implemented as dedicated, purpose-built devices, but increasingly in modern web architectures they are software applications that run on commodity hardware.

### Algorithm

Basic Round robin Scheduling
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_scheduling

## Example with Node

```json
...
http {
  ...
    upstream http_servers {
       server 127.0.0.1:8081;
       server 127.0.0.1:8082;
       server 127.0.0.1:8083;
       server 127.0.0.1:8084;
     }
     …
     server {
       listen: 8080
       server_name  localhost;
       …
       …
location / {
   	  proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  proxy_set_header   Host      $http_host;
  proxy_pass         http://http_servers;
}
       }
}
```

master.js

```javascript
const cp = require("child_process");
const os = require("os");

console.log(`Master running 
  on pid: ${process.pid}`);

for (let i = 0; i < os.cpus().length; i++) {
  cp.fork(`./child`, { env: { id: i + 1 } });
}
```

child.js

```javascript
const http = require("http");
const port = 808 + process.env.id;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.url === "/") {
    // blocking
    for (let i = 0; i < 100000000; i++) {}
    setTimeout(() => {
      res.end("okay");
    }, 0);
  } else {
    res.end();
  }
});

server.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Child Server on port: ${port}, pid: ${process.pid}`);
});
```

## Conclusion

NGINX: Definitely solve more of the issues regarding to security, cache, ssl, load balancing, reverse proxy and so on. Is a great option to be used combined with PM2 or Cluster Module
