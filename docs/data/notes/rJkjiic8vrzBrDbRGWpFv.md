# Static Website using S3

Clear all **Block public access (bucket settings)**

Sync folder with S3 static server

```bash
aws s3 sync docs s3://static.gustavozavaleta.com
```

Give public access where needed

```bash
aws s3 sync docs s3://static.gustavozavaleta.com
```

Consider that exposing your website this way will require an additional configuration for ssl certificate. Escencially you need to set up Cloudfront to use your SSL Certificate (generated by AWS Certificate manager for example)
