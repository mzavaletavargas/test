## Kubernetes development tools

[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/)
[loft-sh/devspace](https://github.com/loft-sh/devspace)
[tilt-dev/tilt](https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt)
[Home - Telepresence](https://www.telepresence.io/)

## Ideas

"All of them solve similar problems but with slightly different conceptual and technical approaches: DevSpace provides a bi-directional, real-time code synchronization that allows for hot reloading of containers, so that code changes are visible without restarting the containers. (The other tools are partly offering this now, too.) It is also focused on development scenarios in cloud-based Kubernetes environments. In contrast to this, Tilt is rather specialized on development with local Kubernetes environments, while Telepresence enables the development of a locally running application that can interact with other parts running remotely. Finally, Skaffold is similar to DevSpace and Tilt but has a bit more focus on fast deployment workflows." https://loft.sh/blog/kubernetes-development-workflow-3-critical-steps/

"You must intentionally curate the experience of: local development, packaging
apps, CI/CD, deployment control, and observability" https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/thecloudnativedeveloperworkflow3-180710182802.pdf

[Ep. #8, Telepresence with Richard Li of Ambassador Labs](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7J3lxr5MxhGVhOWaLr2lv9?si=BBVX4B_3SRqqxu14pKEK_g)

- Telepresence

- Redirect tcp like you are in the cluster
- Is like a con conexion

- Can share current state of local environment

- Work on layer 7

- Telepresence 2 is in go

- Other tools devtools
- Difference

- Scaffold mentioned difference

- Is like a vpn, require less k8s experience

- 1 integrate tp into clusters,
- 2 demo
- 3 mechanicalls is straightforward

- Any size of team numbers

- Scaffold with telepresence

- Rbac supported
